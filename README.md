### Rules
While the goal is to solve the problem I also want to experiment with certain tools.
I will try to adhere to the following rules.
* Use C++
  * Treat all compiler warnings as errors
* Use Bazel
* Use Clang-tidy
* Use Clang-format

These tools shall be run manually or part of some simple automated CI
